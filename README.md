# AI-snake-game


In this code I am using reinforcement learing to teach the software agent how to play snake.  
Ai model is built using a feet forward neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.  
The AI is trained with Deep Q learning by getting a reward for eating food, and a penalty for a game over.
